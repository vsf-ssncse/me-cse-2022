# Why study two server-side frameworks, NodeJS and Django? One will do.
\begin{comment}
Sir, Rationale behind the syllabus is as follows:
First 2 units will cover an introduction to web application development followed by the concepts of client side scripting 
Since the students have to study python framework in units 4  and 5, we thought it would be better to refresh python in 3rd unit as he might have done that course only during his 1st sem in UG curriculum
